# Foundry VTT Install Scripts
Scripts that installs Foundry VTT as smooth as possible, currently aimed at Ubuntu Server LTS.  Mostly throwing this script up for backup purposes, so your milage may vary.

`fvtt.sh` should be run directly on the server as root, usually when the OS is freshly installed.  Generally, most of my Ubuntu servers are virtual private servers (VPS), so root is the default initial login to configure for the system.
